Add 4 new animations to the Timer effects group with the following specs:
1. Pill-shaped countdown timer
2. Counts down minutes:seconds (e.g., 01:40)
3. The closer the timer gets to 0, the more the timer visually alerts the user and creates a visual sense of urgency
4. The 4 animations are distinct at various levels of intensity
5. Every animation follows the principles in docs/animation-short.md, for example layering the main animation with 1 or more subtle secondary animations to create a more professional, pleasing fidelity
