In the Content choreography group we have several animation previews that have elements in their content that have default styling using white background and dark text. They need to be adapted to our actual color scheme.

All animations in the Content choreography group currently only animate content inside the mock modal container. But the purpose of these animations is to demonstrate how to chain animations of opening a modal and animating their content.

For this:
1. Add a good looking modal open animation to all of the mock modals. (these are not actual modals, just containers that look like modals).
2. Make sure that the currently existing animations for the content in these modals are timed so that they create a good looking animation sequence. This means usually that the content animation start playing shortly before the modal is fully opened.

Move the group "Celebration effects" together with all its animations into the Game Elements & Rewards category

In the Wizard Scale Rotate animation preview, highlight the first Step as well as the first tile with a subtle but pleasing border color change.

Remove the animation previews: Tab Tile Swap, Progressive Tile Flow, Tile Highlight Sweep

Modify the Tab Content Morph preview
1. Turn it into an actual working tab component
2. Animate the tab content swiping left right when navigating through the tabs

read README.md and docs/REACT_NATIVE_REFACTORING_PATTERNS.md to understand this project.

the group Standard effects in the Base effects category is supposed to be a showcase of commonly used animation types in mobile games, triple aaa games and best-of-class websites and apps.

1. research and prepare a list of animations that should be showcased (e.g. shake, wiggle, bounce, ripple effect on buttons, etc)
2. enhance your plan to follow the disney animation principle that you have a main animation accompanied by 1 or 2 more subtle secondary animations do provide more depth to animations.
3. then implement new previews for these animations in the Standard effects category.

do not use particle effects.
